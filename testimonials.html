<p>I am a student at HC College doing my Educare Programme Level 5. I enrolled at HC College in February 2017 doing Educare Level 4. Through their quality education and tutoring I managed to pass all my Level 4 modules with 3 distinctions and 1 pass, the highest mark being 99% and the lowest mark was 73%.

They facilitated a place for me to do holiday attachment (work experience) at Cedar Crest Nursery School which helped me to be exposed to my field of industry.  If you are looking to enrol to do Educare or any other programme, HC College is the place to be.  They have qualified lecturers and get you connected. Their quality service is the best of all.

<p>I am 19 years old and this is my first year at HC College and so far I have loved every moment. In the beginning I wanted to go to a big college but after looking at some colleges and universities, I changed my mind. When I looked at HC College it was so convenient for me. It was small, it was close to home and it offered everything needed for my studies. At HC College you are not just a number, they care about you, support you and will always encourage you to do your best!
The classes are small so we get through work a lot quicker, the people are friendly and the staff are so helpful. HC College is a suitable Varsity for any age, race or culture. The classes are fun and quick, you don't sit all day bored out of your mind. The lecturers bring something new to the plate every day! I'm just so happy here and hope I can share my experience with many others.

<p>I am delighted to say that my first semester at HC College was certainly a wonderful experience. There were many factors that brought me to HC College. Among them was the opportunity to study an international qualification in tourism from a different perspective and the amazing part was meeting all the interesting people on Campus.  As a foreign student I have valued the opportunity to study in a rich and diverse environment but the most exciting part was that in a classroom we had about 5-6 students. During my experience at HC College it has given me the chance to sharpen my skills in my field of choice. It has also given me a better understanding of othersâ€™ beliefs and traditions, no matter what region of the world they originated from. This has made my time in college much more enriching and worthwhile.

Itâ€™s been an amazing journey with HC College as I have had the privilege to be taught by inspiring lecturers and have found another family here. I am now working part time for Chaplin PR helping with the marketing for HC College, Route 56 and the Youth 100 Project.
The environment here is very supportive and I would encourage anyone to study here.

<p>This is just a short story about how HC College changed my life. I joined the college in 2016 doing Office Administration. Studying the subjects changed my whole outlook on life. The support and help I received from lecturers was extraordinary, they really went out of their way to make me enjoy and understand the work. The environment in which classes are held are clean, safe and nurturing. My whole life changed, from being a student at HC College to becoming a staff member of HC College.

<p>I studied the CompTIA A+ and the CompTIA Network+ at HC College during the year of 2015. The environment made it great for learning and attending classes. The staff at HC College were very professional and friendly which made coming into classes very relaxed. I am currently employed at Incredible Connection, in Bayside Mall, as a PC Technician. My job is to fix mainly anything IT related. My studies have helped me in my job by teaching me how to fix broken pcs, laptops, mobile devices, etc. Studying at HC College was a great choice.</p>

<p>My experience as a full time Educare student at HC College has been phenomenal. The atmosphere in our classroom and campus is very relaxed which results in a pleasant vibe amongst students and lecturers which makes it easier to study and remain focused.
My lecturer Dr. Neetha Nirhoo is an excellent tutor who makes every lesson easy to understand. A big thanks to her for my achievement of good marks in my past exams. I have passed with 3 distinctions and achieved a high mark of 91% mark in one subject.
Im currently pursuing the N5 level in Educare and anticipating great results once again. I would highly recommend those who would like to pursue their dreams and goals to enroll with HC College to ignite your potential.

  I started with HC College in 2015 with enthusiasm as I wanted to obtain a Diploma in Financial Accounting. As a full time working mom of three and wife it became really tough as I wanted to excel at work and needed to prove to myself and my kids that one can succeed no matter the circumstances.
  With passing my subjects I got promoted to an Accounts Bookkeeper, just after 1 year of studies. I must admit it was not easy but through the guidance, motivation, assistance, advice and all-round care from all management, staff and lectures of HC College I made it through. HC College believed in me and this made me the strong individual I am today.
  I am now a proud Financial Analyst at an amazing company; I could not be in a better space. Believe in yourself and go for greatness.
  â€œOne should never give up their studies because of failure or hardship - failure is there only for a short period and it helps us climb the ladder of success."

<p>It is exactly 15 years ago since I finished my Matric and I was fortunate to be able to further my studies. I knew that it might be different and that I may face some difficulties, but I know I chose the best Service Provider. HC College has been a great help since the beginning. Working full time and having a lot of family responsibilities makes it more difficult to make time for filling in applications etc. HC College made my life less complicated. Communication is core and since I was not in a classroom set up I still needed to ask questions or communicate to someone. HC College would continue to be my first choice of recommended Service Providers because they are professional and excellent communicators. Knowing that my applications and exams date are on time and submitted on my behalf, I can spend more time focusing on studying hard and passing all my subjects to the best of my abilities. Thank you HC College for providing and assisting in the needs of those who have to make use of the Supported Learning methods. My connection between my present and my success. I salute you.

<p>My studies at HC College was only the beginning of an adventure that will last me a lifetime. My search for a suitable tertiary institute was quickly something of the past when I paged through the newspaper. Situated in Table View a place of great value and standards, HC College, a world renowned institute. To my surprise it was the start of their own endeavour and I had the privilege to share with them a year of success. At my arrival, on the first day, I was welcomed with open arms, a friendly and sincere staff who truly showed love and desire to educate young adults to equip them for the world that awaits. My travelling activities from Malmesbury to Table View began to be the least of my worries as each day broug ht out an excitement that I just could not hide. The atmosphere within the campus walls kept you as individual at ease, to always do your best and the staff only contributed by giving the best educational lessons to broaden the knowledge of each pupil.
Being thankful will never describe the love and gratitude I share for each of the staff members as through the year I realised that I was placed in a family who cares for me and will go the extra mile not just for me but for each and every student next to me. Today I am a reshaped individual who thrives for success as this was the attitude that was embedded within me. Thus I want to thank each and every lecturer that was in and on my journey to a brighter future. Thank them for what they did for me and all the students that took part in the course I applied for and your efforts was much appreciated. I hope that this institute thrive in their purpose to educate young minds as well as adults. For such effort is never in vain in the eyes of your students. Keep on doing such a fantastic job in educating the youth as you give us the power to conquer this vast world of opportunities.</p>
