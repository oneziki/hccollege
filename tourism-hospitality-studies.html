<h3 style=font-size:1.2em>What is tourism and hospitality studies?</h3>
</div>
<div class=col_half>
<p>Tourism and Hospitality Management is a multidisciplinary field of study with the purpose of preparing people with the expertise, commitment, and skills for management, marketing, and operations positions in the expanding industry that provides food, accommodations, and tourism services to people away from home. As a field of study, Tourism and Hospitality Management is interdisciplinary. It draws upon a wide range of basic disciplines to provide the fundamental knowledge and skills that are required to fulfil the diverse demands placed upon individuals in management positions within the Hospitality industry. Recognising that the individual educated for today is soon out of date, the academic emphasis of the program is on principles, analytical tools, processes, and
</p>
</div>
<div class="col_half col_last">
<p>systems. These change relatively slowly. However, it is recognised that at least a minimal exposure to the skills and knowledge which make up the present state of the art is necessary to understand the principles. Likewise, it is recognised that the students in the program are composites of many talents, and that in Tourism and Hospitality, pure academic ability cannot predict professional success. Thus, the program has as a basic objective the presentation of an academic curriculum to develop management capability through interdisciplinary subject exposure, problem identification, basic concepts, decision making, theory, and management application.</p>

<h3> CTH: TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY PROGRAMMES (QCF)  <br>All Levels</h3><h4></div>
<img src=images/others/t_2.png alt="CTH Tourism and Hospitality Programme" title="CTH Tourism and Hospitality Programme" class=alignright style=max-width:150px>
<p align=left>Tourism and Hospitality is the world’s single biggest industry, covering everything from international airlines and global hotel chains right down to small family-run restaurants and private tour guiding. The career options are huge and varied.
<br>
CTH professional qualifications focus on developing future management talent for the industry. CTH Management Programmes offer an excellent alternative, or complement to, university study in hospitality and tourism.
<br>
The Confederation of Tourism and Hospitality (CTH) offers undergraduate and postgraduate level programmes specially designed to prepare for the next generation of professionals in this sector.
<br>
Graduates of these programmes typically aspire to management roles, whether at junior trainee level for those completing Level 4 Diploma (formerly known as Diploma) or at senior level for those completing the Level 7 Postgraduate Diploma.<br>
Each programme is specifically geared to a particular learning outcome. For example, the Level 5 Diploma (formerly known as Advanced Diploma) is an ideal pathway course for centres seeking to run a full university “top-up” final year, while the Level 6 Diploma (formerly known as Prograduate Diploma) offers a complete integrated degree level learning package in itself.<br>
In fact, graduates of this programme are able to convert their award into a recognised British university bachelor’s degree from Binary University or BPP University College simply by completing an additional dissertation.
<br>
Upon completion of this course you can further your studies to the next CTH Programme Level as well as gain access to various International Universities:
<br>
<li>London South Bank University</li>
<li>The University of Northampton</li>
<li>The University of West London</li>
<li>Hotel School Sydney</li>
