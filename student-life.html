<p>There’s a nearly irresistible energy at HC College that brings people and ideas together—from the classroom to the campus and beyond. From the outset, HC College (HCV) students are encouraged to engage and interact with one another. For full time students, the year kicks-off with Orientation Week designed to familiarise you with your campus and life at HC College, while providing the opportunity to network, make new friends and have a lot of fun. </p>
<p>The HC College student life is an active one as we believe in providing knowledge not only for the mind but also for the soul. We, as far as possible, will help and assist students to organise and participate in organised events from Gaming evenings through to career expo’s as well as enriching and informative day trips.
Students will benefit in the following ways:</p><p>
<li>Participating in activities creates meaningful interpersonal connections through common experiences and provides a foundation for community development.</li>
<li>Attending events maximises the opportunity to explore meaning, purpose and fosters a sense of belonging in college.</li>
<li>Collaborating with an advisor or mentor in your student organisation assists in developing leadership potential.</li>
<li>Being involved in co-curricular activities provides the balance needed to excel in the classroom.</li>
<li>Collaborating with other students and organisations will enhance the relational aspects of involvement on campus while maximising internship opportunities.</li>

<p>It is not necessary to venture out of Blouberg to find entertainment. The area is well known for its beautiful beaches and often you'll find it packed with water sport fans. Bloubergstrand beach is home to Red Bull's King of The Air kitesurfing event that takes place each year and draws an international crowd. The beach is ideal for jogging, sunbathing, surfing, kite flying, swimming or even a picnic with friends. There are many popular restaurants spots right on the beachfront, ideal for an evening out with friends. Later, you can head over to one of the nearby bars, pubs or nightclubs for drinks or to shoot some pool. They're often filled with friendly locals so it's a great place to make new friends.
Bayside Shopping Mall is conveniently situated in the heart of the Blouberg area, a mere five minute walk from HC College. Students can go grab a quick bite to eat at one of its many trendy coffee shops or even watch a movie. If motorsports is your thing then why not spend your Saturday watching the speed freaks tear up the tar at Killarney Race Track. It is just a quick 5 minute bus ride away using the MyCiti bus service.
Finding student accommodation in Blouberg is not difficult with many of the renting agents catering specifically for student needs.
</p>
<p>Accommodation ranges from comfortable, fully equipped and supervised homes to the security of a hostel living accommodation. Both options are situated in close proximity to the MyCiti Bus Routes. HC College is situated right next to the MyCity Bus Route making transport easily accessible to and from our campus.
</p>
<p>For those wanting private residence, the surrounding areas offer ample affordable accommodation to Cape Town’s student population.
An immediate, updated report of accommodation availability can be provided at any time due to our direct correspondence with estate agencies in the Table View area.
This allows us to readily and gladly assist the students and their families with accommodation needs, and with grouping students together to share accommodation. Please <a href=contact.html>Contact us</a> for more information.</p>

<div class="col_half col">
<h2>Point 1</h2>
<p>Don't be anonymous. Introduce yourself to your facilitators and speak up in class. (I'm not saying you have to sit in the front row, answer every question and bring the facilitator chocolates - did I say chocolates? I meant apples).
Just don't hide in the back of the room and be invisible. Moreover, don't hesitate to ask questions in class; if you're wondering about something, chances are that someone else is too. If you think of a question outside of class time, visit the facilitator during office hours (that's the purpose of office hours) or send an email
</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="tab-content clearfix" id=tabs-34>
<div class="col_half col">
<h2>Point 2</h2>
<p>Read all of your syllabi carefully. The syllabus is your contract for the course. There's no excuse for not being aware of essential information that has been provided to you. In addition, check your email account daily; facilitators and staff members will use email to communicate additional information to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="col_half col_last">
<img src=images/points/point_2.jpg alt="reading syllabus" style=max-width:100%>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tab-content clearfix" id=tabs-35>
<div class="col_half col">
<h2>Point 3</h2>
<p>Stay on top of your work. Try not to procrastinate. "Plan ahead" should be your mantra for your academic life. Nobody ever says "Oh no, I started on that too early," but plenty of students regret waiting until the last minute to begin studying or working on a pr oject. Avoid pulling all-nighters (see below: How to Study).</p>
</div>
<div class="col_half col_last">
<img src=images/points/point_3.jpg alt="plan ahead" style=max-width:100%>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tab-content clearfix" id=tabs-36>
<div class="col_half col">
<h2>Point 4</h2>
<p>Turn in all assignments. It's better to hand something in late than not at all; a zero can really hurt your course grade. If you're struggling with an assignment or you fall behind, talk to your facilitator in advance, not the day said assignment is due. Facilitators are human too (well, most are, anyway) and some will consider giving you an extension, especially if you show evidence of progress on the assignment.</p>
</div>
<div class="col_half col_last">
<img src=images/points/point_4.jpg alt="dont fall behind" style=max-width:100%>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tab-content clearfix" id=tabs-37>
<div class="col_half col">
<h2>Point 5</h2>
<p>Work on improving your writing. Learn how to use commas and semi-colons; they're important. For instance, the difference between "Let's eat, grandma" and "Let's eat grandma" is a dead grandma and my thinking you're a cannibal. In addition, 'there,' 'their' and 'they're' are three different words with three different meanings. Please, please learn how to use these words, and other homonyms, correctly.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="tab-content clearfix" id=tabs-38>
<div class="col_half col">
<h2>Point 6</h2>
<p>Always do the assigned readings, even if there isn't a quiz. Facilitators know when you haven't read, even if they don't call you out on it; you're not fooling anyone.</p>
</div>
<div class="col_half col_last">

</div>
</div>
<div class="tab-content clearfix" id=tabs-39>
<div class="col_half col">
<h2>Point 7</h2>
<p>Be aware of HC College’s attendance policy; missing class can adversely affect your grade. Certain qualifications require you to attend a minimum number of classed, missing classes could lead you to not qualifying.</p>
</div>
<div class="col_half col_last">

</div>
</div>
<div class="tab-content clearfix" id=tabs-40>
<div class="col_half col">
<h2>Point 8</h2>
<p>Be aware of HC College’s academic dishonesty policy and learn how to cite sources correctly. Whether you're writing a paper or giving an oral presentation, you must cite all of your sources. If you do not give credit to the source, you are guilty of plagiarism! I recommend A Pocket Style Manual by Diana Hacker or The Little Seagull Handbook by Richard Bullock and Francine Weinberg. Do not ever, ever, even think about turning in a friend's paper from a previous class or buying a paper from a web site. It's just not worth it. </p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="tab-content clearfix" id=tabs-41>
<div class="col_half col">
<h2>Point 9</h2>
<p>Please use email etiquette; it will make your sweet grandma proud (if you haven't eaten her, that is- see # 5). When emailing a facilitator or staff member whom you don't know, do not use the person's first name. Use his/her title, i.e. Dr, Mr, Ms etc. And for the love of all things good in the world, PLEASE DO NOT USE ALL CAPS, i.e. JAMES, I HAVE TO GET INTO YOUR CLASS OR ELSE...</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="tab-content clearfix" id=tabs-42>
<div class="col_half col">
<h2>Point 10</h2>
<p>If you'd like to be added to a full or rollover course, don't send an email pleading to be added. Drop by the Managing Director’s or Academic Manager’s office instead. When you arrive, do yourself a favour and don't barge in without introducing yourself, talking a mile a minute and making demands; this approach is ineffective. A more appropriate strategy is to introduce yourself, ask her if she has time to talk, and state that you'd like to be added to a course and why (preferably something other than "If you don't let me into your course I'll just die!" complete with tears and jazz hands). Following some basic rules of interpersonal communication will go a long way. If you can't track the MD or Academic Manager down, send an email (see #9) and ask if you can set up a time to meet. Please don't harass or blame her for why you haven't gotten into the course, because chances are, she isn't involved in a conspiracy against you. </p>

<div class="tab-content clearfix" id=tabs-43>
<div class="col_half col">
<h2>Point 11</h2>
<p>If you enjoy a course, let the facilitator know. She/he will appreciate it, and it may help the facilitator to remember you. You never know when you'll need a letter of recommendation or a reference for an internship or a job.</p>
</div>
<div class="col_half col_last">

</div>
</div>
<div class="tab-content clearfix" id=tabs-44>
<div class="col_half col">
<h2>Point 12</h2>
<p>When facilitators/academic managers write you letters of recommendation, send them a thank you note (the kind from the olden days that involve a pen and an envelope!). Writing recommendation letters is a time-consuming task and one that facilitators don't have to do; let them know you appreciate it. And if you get the internship or job, let your facilitator know. Nothing makes us happier than seeing you succeed. This is why we do what we do.</p>

<p>Choose your course carefully, and make sure you're choosing it for you; you're the one who could work in a field connected to that course for, say, 40 YEARS. Work hard for you. Get a full qualification for you, for your future. Believe in yourself.</p>

<p>Remember that education is the key that will open many doors for you. Don't take it for granted. Take advantage of every opportunity to learn and grow as a student and person. Know that learning happens both in and outside the classroom. Join a club, attend a performance and take part in events, volunteer. Now is the time to focus on yourself and your education.</p>

<h3>The EFT Study Method </h3>
<p> The EFT study method as one of the ways that you can use to plan or organise your studies.
<br>
<br>
1. The Exploration Phase: familiarise yourself with the material and content
<br>
During this phase you should:
<li>Scan your curriculum.</li>
<li>Complete your assignments.</li>
<li>Do additional reading.</li>
<li>Discuss the field of study with lecturers and ask questions.</li>
<li>Contact fellow students to discuss the learning material and possibly join study groups.</li>
<li>Make notes and highlight important sections for intensive study.</li>
<li>Use your study guide to identify questions (turn your learning outcomes into questions) and answer the questions as you progress through the subject.</li>
<li>Identify and clarify difficult concepts.</li>
<li>Draw up a timetable: long-term for the year and short-term for each week, planning is important.</li>
</p>
<p>2. The Fixation Phase: study the content systematically by making summaries<br>
<li>Start by paging through the chapter you are working on and read the headings - make a mind-map to get an overview of what this chapter is about.</li>
<li>Page through the chapter again, read the sub-headings and add them to the mind-map. Look at the beginning and end of each paragraph to get a quick overview of important points. Take note of keywords in bold or italics. Ask yourself: "What is this chapter all about?"</li>
<li>Now start to read for understanding. Ask yourself simple questions beginning with "how", "where", "when", "who" and "which". Ask yourself what the main idea is of what you have read and make sure that you understand all the words and concepts.</li>
<li>Now make your notes - remember not to summarise the whole book.</li>
<li>While you are making your notes, you should use different memory techniques.</li>
<li>Memorise the content by using different techniques such as acronyms and visualisation, using different colours help.</li>
</p>
<p>3. The Testing Phase
<br>
<li>You should test yourself at the end of each study session - close your books and answer all the possible questions (get them from your learning objectives).</li>
<li>Revise your work within 24 hours of studying it. You will find that you have forgotten some of it - go back to your summaries and memorise what you have forgotten.</li>
<li>Revise your work every week by trying to recall the core summary and then the schematic summary.</li>
