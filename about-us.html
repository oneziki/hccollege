<div class=content-wrap id=Accreditation style=padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0>
<div class="container center clearfix">
<div class="heading-block center">
<h2>Accreditation</h2>
<span>What is accreditation?</span>
</div>
<p>SAQA defines accreditation as: “The certification usually for a particular period of time, of a person, a body or an institution as having the capacity to fulfil a particular function in the quality assurance system set up by the South African Qualifications Authority.”</p>
<p>Accreditation is awarded to providers who offer outcomes-based learning programmes aligned to the NQF registered unit standards and qualifications. It is given to a provider, usually for a period of three years.
Accreditation must also be seen as an audit process of the provider’s quality system and the learning programme which will be offered. It ensures that learning and assessments result in nationally recognised credits, and ultimately in the achievement of a formal qualification.<br><br>
HC College is registered with the Department of Higher Education and Training as a Private Higher Education Institution: Skills Development Provider through the QCTO (Accreditation no: QCTO Nated/15/0165) and is accredited with MICT SETA, Services SETA and TETA.
</p>
<div class="heading-block center">
<h2></h2>
<span>What SETA stands for?</span>
</div>
<p>SETA stands for Sector Education and Training Authority. It refers to the authoritative educational bodies established under the South African Skills Development Act (97 of 1998). At the moment, there are over 20 different SETAs in South Africa. Each established SETA acts as a training and education quality assurance body in its respective sector, which means that they are highly respected in their specific areas. There are SETAs that deal with tourism; banking; manufacturing; agriculture and more.
</p>
<div class="heading-block center">
<h2></h2>
<span>What are SETA-accredited courses?</span>
</div>
<p>SETAs act as Educational Training and Quality Assurance Bodies (ETQAs) in South Africa. A college that is accredited by an ETQA can offer nationally recognised training. A SETA can thus provide a college with this type of accreditation. SETA accreditation means that a college (or other type of educational institute) can offer SETA-accredited courses. Because SETAs are sector based, they only accredit courses related to their fields. Accreditation by the MICTSETA, for example, means that a college can offer SETA-accredited courses in End User Computing (and its related subjects). The ‘stamp of approval’ that a SETA gives indicates that the courses in question are valuable, outcomes-based training programmes, and that they are relevant to the work involved in a specific industry. </p>
<div class="heading-block center">
<h2></h2>
<span>Where can I take a SETA-accredited course?</span>
</div>
<p>You can study a number of SETA-accredited courses at HC College by means of classroom based lectures or Supported Learning (correspondence). <br>These courses are accredited by a number of different SETAs, offering training in a variety of professions. Take a look at the courses we have to offer (click on any course name if you want more information about that specific programme).
</p>
<div class="heading-block center">
<h2></h2>
<span>What is the difference between a Qualification and a learning programme?</span>
</div>
<p>Qualifications and Unit Standards, governed by the NSB regulations and developed by expert stakeholder groupings, prescribe the outcomes, assessment criteria and other relevant detail for learner achievement. These guide the educator/assessor with regard to what the learner needs to know, do and apply. A learning programme consists of learning and assessment activities derived from the outcomes that make up the Qualification.</p>
<div class="heading-block center">
<h2>Institutes</h2>

<p>HC College is affiliated to and accredited by numerous leading institutions in business, tourism, hospitality and IT. These professional bodies safeguard the interests of industry professionals.</p>
<p>There is normally a professional body for every field of interest. The bookkeepers and office administrators have the ICB, business administration have the IBS and CSSA. International bodies also exist to watch over international qualifications like the Confederation of Tourism and Hospitality (CTH) and their sister South African counterpart ITHSA for tourism and hospitality. For the IT industry we have CompTIA, Microsoft IT Academy and ICDL watching over a broad spectrum of IT qualifications from end user computing to specialised fields of study such as A+ and N+.</p>
<p>Within South Africa we also have quality assurance agencies who watch over and ensure the validity of national qualification like FASSET SETA for finance and accounting studies, MICT SETA for IT and Media related studies, TETA SETA for Supply Chain Management and the QCTO for Nated Programmes (N4 –N6).</p>

<h2>Corporate Social Responsibility</h2>
<span>HC College is always striving to help those less fortunate to further their education</span>
<!--<div class=oc-item><img src=images/3_logos_round.png alt="3 round logo" title="Corporate Social Responsibility"></div> -->
</div>
<!--<p>In the spirit of igniting the potential in our youth, HC College and Chaplin PR have come on board with the Youth 100 Project to assist the South African school leavers and unemployed youth. Our goal is to help those less fortunate to acheive their dreams of furthering their education and making a success of their lives.</p>
<p>
HC College is sponsoring 50% of the tuition fees for these youth who have been identified and selected by the Youth 100 Project. These individuals will benefit from an accredited skills programme or national qualification. The study areas that will currently add the greatest value to the students are Business, Finance, Educare, Computers (IT), Hospitality and Tourism.
</p>
<p>
Youth 100 Project are actively approaching corporates to come on board and sponsor between R1000 and R20000 annually towards the identified students 50% of the course fees. As a corporate, your sponsorship will be allocated towards paying the 50% value of the course fee. Full qualification certificates average +- R40 000 per annum and include all study material and examination fees.
The idea is also to pursue experiential learning opportunities and internships, through the network, for these students, who could in turn become a potential employee.
