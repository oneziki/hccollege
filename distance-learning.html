<p>Supported Learning allows you to study in your own time and place. This means that, to a large extent, you are independent and you have to take control of your studies.
</p>
<p>HC College’s Supported Learning (correspondence) studies are for you if you have a full time job and can’t take off time to attend full times or part time classes or maybe you travel a lot. With our Supported Learning courses we will send you your study material according to the HC College academic calendar, what this means is that we send you study material as you complete a subject, by doing it this way you can be assured that you always have up-to-date learning material that is always relevant. We offer you dedicated support, a fee that includes all your study material and in some instances you exam and membership fee to the applicable institute (this may vary as it is course dependant) and the best service ever.</p>
<p>On top of all this we have a wide range of part time courses to choose from, these span from our national qualifications in business management, administration, accounting, finance and IT to our internationally recognised courses in end user computing, computer support technician to our ever popular tourism and hospitality courses.</p>
<p><h3 style=font-size:1em>How does this work?</h3>You have to plan your personal life to allow for study time and, if you are a working student, you need to discuss the additional responsibilities of studying with your employer. Most importantly, you have to make use of the study materials and other resources by following all instructions and completing all activities.</p>
<p><h3 style=font-size:1em>Personal circumstances</h3>Studying in your own time and place (independently) means that you will be in your own environment most of the time. You may be a working mother or father, or you may have other family members that demand some of your time. Participating in sports may be important to you and you may like to spend time with your friends as well. A demanding hobby that you are passionate about may also require a lot of your time. You need to plan your time carefully; otherwise you will not be able to study regularly and be successful. Supported Learning allows you to continue your life, but it does involve some sacrifices. You will have to discuss your studies with family and friends in order to ensure that they respect your aspirations and allow you the time you need for studying.</p>
<p><h3 style=font-size:1em>Work and study</h3>A substantial number of students who make use of Supported Learning are also employed. In fact, that is one of the biggest advantages of Supported Learning, you can work and study. But once again, it does take careful planning because when you arrive home after a hard day’s work you still have to make time to study.</p>
<p><h3 style=font-size:1em>Planning your studies</h3>Effective time management can provide the means you need to succeed as a distance education student. If you pace yourself, study regularly and complete assignments in a timely manner, you will find it easier to stay on track and complete your course on time. Being a responsible student is necessary for any type of education; however, in distance education, it is a vital component of success.</p>
<p>It will be important to discuss with all parties involved, especially your family, where and when you want to study. There will have to be quiet time for you to study in a place that is conducive to learning. It is also important to remember that although you need to set aside lots of time to engage in education from a distance, you still need to make sure that you have a balanced life. So you will have to spend time with family and friends, do sports and engage in the things that you are passionate about.</p>
